However, many top trail running brands like **Hoka**, **Altra**, **Salomon**, and **Brooks** do offer models known for secure, snug fits that work well for narrow feet on rugged, technical trails.\n\nFor example:\n- **Salomon Speedcross** or **Trailcross** \u2013 often praised for their precise, narrow toe-box fit and aggressive grip.\n- **Brooks Cascadia** \u2013 available in narrow widths (in some models/regions), with great stability.\n- **Hoka Tecton X** or **Speedgoat** \u2013 snug heel and midfoot fit, though some find them roomy; worth trying in narrow if available.\n\nSince fit is so personal, I recommend checking out **REI\u2019s shoe finder** or **Running Warehouse**, where you can filter by width and terrain type. If you're in a region where **custom fitting** is available, visiting a specialty running store can make all the difference.\n\nLet me know your preferred brand or location\u2014I can help guide you further! \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f\ud83d\udc5f",
